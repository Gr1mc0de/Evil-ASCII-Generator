EAG is a random generator of evil ASCII art collected from all around the Internet and was built with HTML, CSS & Javascript.
It was created for entertainment purposes only and I do not own the rights to the ASCII art included.
If the artist tag for any of the artwork isn't displayed, it's because it wasn't available at the source. 
For any missing tags to be added or in case you want an image removed, feel free to reach out to me on Instagram @ grimc0de of by email @ GR1MC0DE@proton.me .
